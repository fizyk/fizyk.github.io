I've just released another 8th maintenance release of 1.2.x branch of
**fzTagPlugin**, that allows to tag models.

.. TEASER_END

This release translates the tag's list page, which somehow slipped
untranslated before. It also allows for some basic list configuration
from app.yml:

-  sort orderÂ 
-  number of tags displayed on one page.
