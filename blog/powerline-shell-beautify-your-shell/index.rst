.. description: Powerline-shell is a great way to enhance your bash console

There are hacks to make your terminal more developer friendly. Like displaying current virtual env, and git branch. But there are ways to display these things more clearly as well. One of such ways is `Powerline-shell <https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell>`_

.. TEASER_END

Powerline-shell provides you with nice looking terminal prompt that shows your both current git branch, current virtualenv environment, the state of previous call, and the quick look at git status. It shows you if there are any new files in the repository tree, and how many commits behind or forward it is from **origin** repository.

To set up fonts on Ubuntu 13.04, should be enough to follow `these instructions <https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation/linux.html#fontconfig>`_.
