After over a month of work I've finally released version 0.3.0 of pyramid_fullauth!
This release changes are mostly to testing the package, as with it, it finally reached 100% code coverage, but along I also introduced automatic style checking with pep8, pylint, pep257 and mccabe linter, so in-code changes were big enough, that I had to release it as a new minor version.

Plans for the future:
---------------------

- python3 support, in two phases:
    #. partial, for non-social authentication
    #. pull request for pytest-dbfixtures python3 compatibility
    #. full by finding alternative to velruse and/or python-oauth2
- Think through number of events. Views can be easily inherited to extend functionality
- introduce form framework.
