I've just released new version of **fzTagPlugin**, which introduces
Spanish translation files created by Alex Otero.

.. TEASER_END

Changelog:

-  fizyk: Spanish translation (**Alex Otero**)
-  fizyk: ability to create multiple instances of different tag clouds
-  fizyk: ability to create tag cloud out of custom tag collection
-  fizyk: updated TagCanvas to **1.6.1**

Additional plugin's resources:

-  Github pages:

   -  `plugin's page <https://github.com/fizyk/fzTagPlugin>`_
   -  `diff between 1.2.6 and
      1.2.7 <https://github.com/fizyk/fzTagPlugin/compare/v1.2.6...v1.2.7>`_

-  `Symfony's plugin page <http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/fzTagPlugin>`_

On a side note, I'm slowly working on a private message system for
sfDoctrineGuard powered symfony websites. Current code can be found
`here <https://github.com/fizyk/fzPrivateMessagePlugin>`_. It won't be
anything fancy, and would rather need some customizations. At least in
first few versions.
