I've just upgraded **fzTagPlugin** to 1.2.6 adding new version of
`TagCanvas <http://www.goat1000.com/tagcanvas.php>`_ library and some
new options.

.. TEASER_END

This new version of tag canvas is able to show weighted tags on cloud.
There's however some bug with hiding original tags list, so I had to add
"manual" hide call if the option for hideTags is set.

Overall I released two version of fzTag today (**1.2.5** and shortly
after **1.2.6**), becouse I realised that the default css declarations
are not playing well with TagCanvas' and becouse of that hideTags bug.
