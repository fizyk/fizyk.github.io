It seemed  about time, I did something with my blog, since I don't do much php (if any) lately, it seemed like a neat idea to create something in python, and pyramid would be my choice since I program with it a lot for about a year now, but... well didn't had the time to implement it from scratches, because it would take a lot more time than just thinking it through.

So, what then? `Nikola <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/>`_! I've been observing this project for a while, and though about some integration with my projects, but also seems like a neat idea to move my blog into.

I still have to tinker around nikola, to get to know it better, tweak default layout to my linking (still based on bootstrap), and fix older posts, and import comments from my old blog.
