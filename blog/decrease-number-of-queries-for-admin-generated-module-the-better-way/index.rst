Recently I saw two posts in the symfony blogosphere about decreasing
number of queries in admin generated module (in January on `Techie
Corner <http://www.techiecorner.com/1963/how-to-reduce-admin-generator-query-in-symfony-1-4/>`_,
and today on `Symfony
world <http://symfony-world.blogspot.com/2011/02/less-doctrine-queries-in-symfony-admin.html>`_
- which prompted me to write this post). And both bloggers seemed to be
happy with overwriting buildQuery method of the module's action class.
But **generator.yml** provides more elegant solution for admin generated
modules.

.. TEASER_END

When I first saw that solution on techiecorner, I thought: "*hmmm.. that
could be useful*\ ", but then, I looked at my generator.yml file and saw
**table\_method** i placed there long time ago...

.. code-block:: yaml

    generator:
      param:
        config:
          list:
            table_method: getAdminNotes

And while both, overwriting buildQuery and setting table\_method can
achieve same goal, I think table\_method is more elegant, as it keeps
your query in your ModelTable, and can be reused in other part of your
project as well.

Book <http://www.symfony-project.org/reference/1_4/en/06-Admin-Generator#chapter_06_sub_table_method>`_.
