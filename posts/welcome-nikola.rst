It seemed  about time, I did something with my blog, since I don't do much php (if any) lately, it seemed like a neat idea to create something in python, and pyramid would be my choice since I program with it a lot for about a year now, but... well didn't had the time to implement it from scratches, because it would take a lot more time than just thinking it through.

So, what then? Nikola! I've been observing this project for a while, and though about some integration with my projects, but also seems like a neat idea to move my blog into.
