New version of sfForkedDoctrineApply plugin has been released. Actually
it was released twice (1.5.7 and a day later 1.5.8), because of my
mistake spotted by **John Kary** (thanks!).

What's changed in 1.5.8 version?

-  Dutch translation prepared by Jasper Moelker
-  several fixes to other translations
-  Unification of setting main keys. All settings that previously needed
   to be set in sfApplyPlugin key can now be set in sfForkedApply key,
   with the old one still present as a fallback

Last change was suggested by \ **Pierre Bonneau**. While keeping
original keys made sense if someone upgraded rom original plugin, it was
rather inconvenience for someone who started with sfForked. Well...
there's no inconvenience anymore! ;)
