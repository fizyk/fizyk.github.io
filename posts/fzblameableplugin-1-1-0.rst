About half year has pased since the release of sfDoctrineGuard 5.x. I
decided, that it was the time to update default values for fzBlameable
behaviour.

Since now, you don't have to chenge the created\_by and updated\_by
field length in Behaviour definition if you run your website on
sfDoctrineuard 5.x, ut you'll have to set fields length to 4, if you
haven't upgraded your sfDoctrineGuard yet.

Adittionally this release allows you to change foreignAlias on relation
between sfGuardUser and your blameable model.
